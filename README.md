# RSA-numbers
To generate RSA numbers of bitlength between (62,2050) and store it's factors in FactorDB
Since factoring RSA numbers are hard, this script attempts to store the factors of RSA numbers just by creating it. This means when we try to factorize a RSA number, 
instead of factorizing it by heavy computation we can get the factors from the database itself.

"The more you run this script, the sooner we can get the factors of all RSA numbers"

Note: This program runs only when you are connected to the internet
